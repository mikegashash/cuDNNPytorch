# cuDNNPytorch

Check if CUDA (GPU support) is available and set the device accordingly.
Define a simple CNN architecture and load the CIFAR-10 dataset and apply transformations.
Move the model to the GPU device if available and define the loss function (cross-entropy) + optimizer (SGD).
Train the model using the training data, utilizing the GPU for acceleration and evaluate the trained model on the test set + print the accuracy.

Ensure you have CUDA installed and configured properly to run this code. 

Also, make sure to adjust batch sizes, learning rates, and other hyperparameters as needed for your specific task.
